# Data-Collection

The Data Collection component of the repository provides all necessary tools to ensure controlled experimental execution and synchronized multimodal data acquisition. It focuses on the reliable capture of EEG signals together with precise event markers corresponding to imagined speech tasks.

**PsychoToolbox Based Experimental Protocol**

This subsection includes scripts implemented in PsychoToolbox, designed to support the execution of imagined speech experiments in a controlled and reproducible manner. The protocol defines:

•	The temporal structure of each trial (e.g., fixation, cue presentation, imagined speech interval, rest).

•	Visual and/or auditory cues corresponding to imagined speech prompts (e.g., NATO alphabet letters, English–Greek words).

•	Precise triggering of event markers aligned with experimental events.

The PsychoToolbox implementation ensures:

•	High temporal precision suitable for EEG experiments.

•	Flexibility to adapt the protocol to different imagined speech vocabularies and task designs.

•	Consistency across recording sessions and participants.

All experimental parameters (timings, stimuli lists, repetitions) are configurable, allowing the protocol to be reused or extended for future studies.

**LabRecorder for Synchronized Data Capture**

To enable seamless and synchronized recording of EEG signals and experimental markers, the repository integrates LabRecorder based on the Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) framework.
This component ensures:

•	Concurrent acquisition of continuous EEG data streams.

•	Reliable recording of event markers generated by the PsychoToolbox protocol.

•	Accurate temporal alignment between neural signals and imagined speech events.

The provided configuration and usage guidelines facilitate robust data logging across different recording setups, minimizing data loss and synchronization errors. This design choice supports downstream segmentation and analysis with high temporal fidelity.
